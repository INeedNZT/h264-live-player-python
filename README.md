# For this project

The [h264-live-player](https://github.com/131/h264-live-player) is a great project, especially when you have limited computational resources on your streaming server but still want a real-time live streaming effect. Since the server for this project is written in Node.js, it can be a bit challenging for Python beginners. I write a simple **Flask** and **Flask-Sock** application demo to serve as an introductory exploration for the h264-live-player.


# Installation/demo
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py

# browse to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for a demo player
```
